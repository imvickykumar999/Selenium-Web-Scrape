    <h1> Introduction on Writing Business Logics on Python </h1>

    ['<p>In this session, Favio will be using Python to write several business logics that can benefit the business of the company.\xa0The logics that we will be writing are as follows:The company wants to reward customers who have high lifetime values (LTVs) as these are the customers that we want to retain for as long as possible. In order to solve this logic, we will be sorting all the customers in decreasing order of LTV.Next, we want to create a column that can tag each customer as having a “high LTV” or a “low LTV.”Finally, we will quickly recall how to create a class where we can put all our business logics in one place.You can download the database and the codes used by Favio in this session from the link below.</p><br>', '<p>In the next segment, Favio will start by solving the first logic.\xa0Guidelines for in-module questionsThe in-video and in-content questions in this module are not graded. Note that graded questions are provided in a separate session titled “Graded Questions” at the end of this module.\xa0People you will hear from in this moduleAdjunct FacultyFavio VázquezData Scientist, H2O.aiFavio is a computer engineer with an MSc in physics.
