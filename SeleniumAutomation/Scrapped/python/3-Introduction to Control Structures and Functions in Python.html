    <h1> Introduction to Control Structures and Functions in Python </h1>

    ["<p>Welcome to the third\xa0session on\xa0'Control Structures and Functions'.\xa0\xa0Control structures are the essence of programming;\xa0they help computers do what they do best:\xa0automate repetitive tasks intelligently. The most common control structures are if-else statements, for and while loops, and\xa0list and dictionary comprehensions. This session will cover all these concepts.\xa0Another crucial thing you will learn in this session\xa0is how to write your own functions. Almost every powerful program, be it a web app or a machine learning algorithm, is basically a set of functions written to perform specific tasks.\xa0In this sessionIn this session, you will learnControl structuresIf-elif-elseFor loopWhile loopList comprehensionsDictionary comprehensionsFunctionsMapFilterReduceYou can download the Python notebooks used in the lecture from the link below. It is recommended that you keep executing the commands on your computer at pace with the lecture. You can also parallelly try experimenting with other commands that you may have in mind.\xa0\xa0</p><br>", '<p>People you will hear from in this sessionSubject Matter ExpertVaidehi TakalikarEX- Senior\xa0Software\xa0Engineer, CapgeminiVaidehi is a postgraduate in Computer Science and Engineering and has more than six\xa0years of rich experience in the areas of software development and maintenance in the IT field.
