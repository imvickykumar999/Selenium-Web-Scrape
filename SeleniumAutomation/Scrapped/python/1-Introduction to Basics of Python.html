    <h1> Introduction to Basics of Python </h1>

    ["<p>Welcome to the\xa0course on Python for Data Science. In this course, you will learn to write basic Python programs followed by gaining the knowledge of the relevant libraries required for working with data. You will also then work with real datasets to understand how a structured analysis can be performed on a dataset.\xa0So let's get started. In this module, you will learn how to write Python codes from scratch using Jupyter notebooks.\xa0This Python content equips you with all the essential\xa0knowledge required for the basic Python coding skills. It is divided into three modules.The first module is 'Python Programming' which covers the fundamentals of Python Programming language.Next module is 'Python Libraries' where you will learn about the various libraries used for Data Analysis.Then we move on to the\xa0third module, which talks about 'Python Programming'\xa0In this moduleYou will get familiarize in working with the basic syntax of Python and introduced to certain programming basics of Python language. Let's hear from our SME Vaidehi</p><br>", '<p>The first module includes four sessions:Basics of Python: This session introduces you to Python Programming and the environment you require for coding. Once you have the basic setup ready, you will learn to write your first program in Python, followed by learning about different data types. Finally, towards the end of the session, you will look at various arithmetic and string operations supported by Python.\xa0Data Structures in Python: The session starts with Introducing various data structures in Python, which include tuples, lists, sets and dictionary. Further, you learn about all these data structures in detail and various operations related to them.Control Structure and Functions in Python: This session is the essence of programming since they help computers do what they do best â€” automate repetitive tasks intelligently. It incorporates all the decision making control structures and functions supported by Python.\xa0OOP in Python: This session will teach you about the various object-oriented programming methodologies in Python that includes classes, objects and methods.\xa0</p><br>']
