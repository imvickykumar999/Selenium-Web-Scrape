So, let’s get started.</p><br>', '<p>So, this video helped you to get well acquainted with the different aspects of team communication. Let’s quickly summarise what you have just learnt:Teamwork, communication, appropriate behaviour, and collaboration are essential pillars of the corporate world.Before effective team communication comes team formation, and it is a complete process in itself and is divided into four stages, as listed below:Recruitment - Suitable people are selected to be a part of a team.Conflicts - Ideologies and the way of doing things often differ from one person to another in a team; hence, this could become the source of a conflict.Normalisation - Things start to get normal once you are well acquainted with all the members of your team, mainly with regard to their strengths and weaknesses.Performance - After the normalisation stage comes the final performance stage. In this stage, the team works efficiently by optimally utilising the strengths of all the members.Communication plays a vital role in the smooth functioning of a team.A common example of poor team dynamics is when one team is aware of an existing problem but the other team refuses to acknowledge it. This should be avoided at all costs as it further complicates the problem and lowers the productivity and efficiency of both the teams involved.It is important for the teams to take ownership of the problem and then work together to resolve it in an efficient manner. Different teams are required to know their roles and functions accordingly.Organisations must work to create an ecosystem where communication is encouraged between teams to improve relationships.Team communication and interacting with other people helps establish trust and facilitates productivity. It helps in bridging the trust deficit in teams.There are ways to foster effective communication within a team. They are as follows:Familiarity - It is important to become familiar with the members of your team, as not doing so could hamper the quality of communication within the team.Ownership - Understand your responsibilities and finish your tasks on time and in an efficient manner.Conflict Resolution - Be gentle and kind with your team members. Offer them flexibility where possible and do not be rigid with them or the other team. Such behaviour hinders the resolution of any conflict.Intermingle - It is important that you get acquainted with other colleagues in your organisation, particularly those from different departments and hierarchical positions so as to facilitate and enable effective collaboration and communication.Finally, build trust among the team members and other colleagues in the organisation and be consistent in your communication with everyone.In the next segment, Rakesh will share with you some guidelines to master online and offline meetings.</p><br>']
