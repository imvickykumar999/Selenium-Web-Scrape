    <h1> Blockchain types, immutability & other features - Introduction </h1>

    ["<p>Welcome to the module on Blockchain features!\xa0Having understood the concepts of cryptography, hash, Merkle root, digital signatures and consensus mechanisms, you now know how\xa0blockchain is an amalgamation of all these features that provides a robust solution.In this moduleIn this module, you will explore the different types of blockchains and understand why a specific type applies to a scenario.\xa0You will also understand how blockchain leverages cryptographic hashes and consensus mechanisms to ensure immutability of data.Further, while blockchain provides the quantitative benefits of disintermediation and immutability, you will learn about the qualitative benefits of global reach\xa0and trustlessness that leads to flexibility.Next, you will learn about a crucial element that enhances trustlessness and eliminates the need for an intermediary - smart contract.Finally, we will end the module by providing you with a high-level architectural overview of the complete blockchain ecosystem.In this sessionIn this session, you will learn about the various types of blockchains in addition to the features of immutability and the qualitative features of global reach and trustlessness. The topics covered in this session areTypes of blockchainsImmutabilityBlockchain as a future promiseSession objectivesBy the end of this session, you will be able toEvaluate the applicability of different types of blockchains in a business scenarioDetermine how a blockchain ensures immutability of dataDiscuss the blockchain features of global reach and trustlessness in doing businessPrerequisitesYou should have gone through the 'Blockchain Basics'\xa0module to have a basic understanding of the key terms used in the blockchain system.\xa0People you will hear from in this sessionSubject Matter ExpertShebin John SamuelManaging Consultant, IBMShebin John Samuel has 11+ years of experience, with Global Technology organizations, in delivering innovative business solutions for Banking & Financial Services industry both in Indian and International markets.
