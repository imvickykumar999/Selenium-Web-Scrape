    <p> ['Welcome to the first segment of Data Analysis in Excel. In this segment, you will understand the Excel interface and learn how to read a typical data file and the structure of the Excel interface. If you are completely new to Excel (or have minimal experience of using it), this is the place to start!\xa0\xa0In the entire first session, we will use the hospital charges \xa0data set. You are requested to download the data file from the bottom of this page.\xa0<br><br>', 'You are now clear with where the majority of Excel tool boxes are located - the poweful Ribbon Bar!\xa0 Next, we\'ll move towards reading and analysing the data itself.\xa0But before we start analysing the dataset, let\'s understand what we\'re going to accomplish in this session.\xa0The Hospital Charges dataset has\xa0more than 150,000 records of treatment of various ailments in several US hospitals. Some stats about the dataset:The dataset has a record of 100 ailments.It has a list of 3,000+ healthcare providers (hospitals, medical centres, etc.).It has data from 50 states of the\xa0USA and approximately 2,000 cities across the\xa0USA.It describes the cost of treatment for approximately 7 million patients.Each record (or row) is a unique combination of state, city, ailment & provider. It also lists the average cost of treatment for a particular ailment.\xa0How are we going to use this dataset?We are going to analyse this "raw" dataset and prepare a "report" having the list of providers treating a specific ailment in a particular state of USA. Subsequently, we will rank providers by the\xa0cost of treatment.Such a "report" will be extremely useful to government agencies and patients across the state. Instead of analysing the entire dataset, they will now use this report to\xa0find the cheapest healthcare provider in their city. Think of this report like a sorted "Yellow Pages" or "Dictionary".\xa0In the process, we will learn about some tools that help in analysis like:Sort & FilterConditional FormattingWe will also learn about formatting tools that make a report readable.So, without any further delay, let\'s step into making this report.\xa0In the next video, you\'ll understand more about the dataset.\xa0<br><br>', 'In the next segment, you will learn some of the most useful and frequently used operations in Excel - sort and filter.\xa0\xa0DownloadsYou can download the hospital - charges\xa0data file here.<br><br>', '\xa0\xa0\xa0<br><br>'] </p>
