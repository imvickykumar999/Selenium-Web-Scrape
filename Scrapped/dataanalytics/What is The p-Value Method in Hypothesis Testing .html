    <p> ['Let’s get started with the p-value method of making a decision.<br><br>', 'Prof. Tricha has defined p-value as the probability that\xa0the null hypothesis\xa0will not be\xa0rejected. This statement is not the technical\xa0(or formal) definition of p-value;\xa0it is used for better understanding of the p-value.The higher the p-value, the higher is the probability of failing to reject a null hypothesis. And\xa0the lower the p-value, the higher is the probability of the null hypothesis being rejected.<br><br>', 'After formulating the null and alternate hypotheses, the steps to follow in order to make a decision using the\xa0p-value method are as follows:Calculate the value of the z-score for the sample mean point on the distribution.Calculate the p-value from the cumulative probability for the given z-score using the z-table.Make a decision on the basis of the p-value (multiply it by 2 for a two-tailed test) with respect to the given value of α (significance value).\xa0To find the correct p-value from the z-score,\xa0find the cumulative probability\xa0first, by simply looking at the z-table, which gives you the area under the curve till that point.\xa0Situation 1: The sample mean is on the right side of the distribution mean (the z-score is positive).\xa0Example: z-score for sample point = + 3.02<br><br>', 'Cumulative probability of the sample point = 0.9987\xa0For a one-tailed test:\xa0p = 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013For a two-tailed test:\xa0p = 2 (1 - 0.9987) = 2 * 0.0013 = 0.0026\xa0Situation 2:\xa0The sample mean is on the left side of the distribution mean (the z-score is negative).\xa0Example:\xa0The z-score for the sample point = -3.02 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0<br><br>', '\xa0Cumulative probability of the sample point = 0.0013\xa0For a one-tailed test:\xa0p = 0.0013For a two-tailed test:\xa0p = 2 * 0.0013 = 0.0026<br><br>', 'You learnt how to perform the three steps of the p-value method through the AC sales problem as well as the product life cycle comprehension problem given above.<br><br>'] </p>
