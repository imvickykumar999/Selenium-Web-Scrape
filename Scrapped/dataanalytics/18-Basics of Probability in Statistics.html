    ['<p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood of the occurrence of an event. Measures of probability range from 0 to 1; zero means an impossible event and 1 means a certain event.\xa0TerminologyTrial or experiment: This refers to an action, the result of which is uncertain. For example, throwing a dice, tossing a coin, etc.Event: This refers to a\xa0single result of an experiment.Sample space: This is the total number of possible outcomes of an experiment.Sample point: This refers to one of the possible outcomes.\xa0FormulaThe probability of an event = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomesA few common experiments and important points to remember are as follows:Tossing a coinThis can lead to two possible outcomes:HeadsTailsThe probability of getting either heads or tails is the same,\xa0and it is equal to 0.5.\xa0Throwing a dieThis can lead to six outcomes; you can get any value between 1 and 6, both included:The probability of the occurrence of any number on the die is 1/6.\xa0Picking a card from a deck of cardsThis can lead to 52 outcomes. A deck consists of:13 cards of hearts,13 cards of spades,13 cards of clubs, and13 cards of diamonds.\xa0Balls of different colours in a bag\xa0Steps to find probability:1: List every possible outcome of the experiment being performed.2: Count every possible outcome of the experiment.3: Count all the favourable outcomes.4: Use the probability formula to determine the probability of the occurrence of an event.\xa0Demonstrations: Basic Probability1. If you toss two coins simultaneously, what is the probability of you getting heads in both the cases?Solution:\xa0Total number of possible outcomes = 4, i.e., (H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)Total number of favourable outcomes = 1, i.e., (H,H)Thus, P = 1/4.\xa02. If you throw two dice simultaneously, what is the probability of you getting the same number on both of them?Solution:\xa0Total number of possible outcomes = 6 x 6 = 36Total number of favourable outcomes = 6, i.e., (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)Thus, the probability of you getting the same number on both dice = 6/36 = 1/6.\xa03. What is the probability of you getting an ace from a deck of cards?Solution:\xa0Total number of favourable outcomes = 4 (ace of each type of card)Total number of possible outcomes = 52Thus, P = 4/52 = 1/13.</p><br>']
