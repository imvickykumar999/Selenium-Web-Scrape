    <h1> Introduction to Smart Contracts and Blockchain Architecture </h1>

    ['<p>Welcome to the session on "Smart Contracts and Architecture of Blockchain". Let us walk you through the plan for this session.\xa0In this sessionIn this session, you will learn a few basic concepts related to smart contracts and the architecture of blockchain. Broadly speaking, the topics that will be covered in this session are:Smart ContractsComponents required for deploying a Smart Contract on a blockchainBlockchain Architecture vis-à-vis Traditional Architecture\xa0For the sake of simplicity, we will be using a bitcoin blockchain as an example to explain architectural concepts. Smart Contracts are independent of bitcoin blockchain because ‘smart contract’ is a concept of its own. In this session, we’re explaining the logic behind a smart contract only. \xa0Also, if these terms sound a little alien to you right now, you need not worry. By the time you have finished this module, you would be comfortable in discussing terms like smart contracts or oracles confidently with others. This session will also enable you to differentiate between a traditional architecture from the architecture of a blockchain, and how blockchain interacts with the traditional software architecture.\xa0Guidelines for in-module questionsThe in-video and in-content questions for this module are not graded.People you will hear from in this sessionSubject Matter ExpertShebin John SamuelManaging Consultant, IBM\xa0Shebin John Samuel has 11+ years of experience, with Global Technology organizations, in delivering innovative business solutions for the Banking & Financial Services industry both in Indian and International markets.
