    ['<p>The previous session helped you understand the problem statement and the business objectives in this case study. You also learned that we will be using SQLite, Python, and Tableau to perform the case study.\xa0Further, you learned how to work with SQLite on Python with the help of the SQLite library and were given a basic introduction to the Pandas library, which we will be using to run more complex analysis on Python.\xa0Before we get started with the case study, in the forthcoming video, Favio will quickly recall the data that we have at hand. Let us go ahead and watch the video.</p><br>', '<p>You can download the slides, data and the codes used by Favio in this session from the link below.</p><br>', '<p>In the next segment, we will start with the case study.\xa0Guidelines for in-module questionsThe in-video and in-content questions in this module are not graded. Note that graded questions are provided in a separate session titled “Graded Questions” at the end of this module.\xa0People you will hear from in this moduleAdjunct FacultyFavio VázquezData Scientist, H2O.aiFavio is a computer engineer with an MSc in physics.
