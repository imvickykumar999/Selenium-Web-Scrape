    <p> ['Welcome to this module on ‘Creating Customer Value’.\xa0Have you ever bargained while shopping off the street? Or picked up some simple-looking clothing in a mall, checked the price and kept it back because you thought it was too expensive?On the other hand, there may have been times when you bought an expensive perfume without batting an eye.\xa0\xa0\xa0Why does this happen?\xa0\xa0Well, everytime before you buy something, you ask yourself as a consumer, "Is what I am going to receive worth what I have to give up?"\xa0The benefit received by the consumer is weighed against the cost of what the consumer would have to pay to acquire the benefit. And given a choice, consumers will always pick something that has higher consumer value for them.
