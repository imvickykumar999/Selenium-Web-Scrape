    <h1> Introductio to Multivariate Logistic Regression - Model Building </h1>

    <p> ["Welcome to the session on 'Multivariate Logistic Regression (Model Building)'.\xa0Just like when you’re building a model using linear regression,\xa0one independent variable might not be enough to capture all the uncertainties of the target variable in logistic regression as well. So in order to make good and accurate predictions, you need multiple variables and that is what we’ll study in this session.\xa0Before starting with multivariate logistic regression, the first question that arises is, “Do you need any extensions while moving from univariate to multivariate logistic regression?” Recall the equation used in the case of univariate logistic regression was:\xa0P=11+e−(β0+β1X)\xa0The above equation has only one feature variable X, for which the coefficient is β1. Now, if you have multiple features, say n, you can simply extend this equation with ‘n’ feature variables and ‘n’ corresponding coefficients such that the equation now becomes:\xa0P=11+e−(β0+β1X1+β2X2+β3X3+...+βnXn)\xa0Recall this extension is similar to what you did while moving from simple to multiple linear regression.\xa0In this sessionIn this session, you will learn how to:Build a multivariate logistic regression model in PythonConduct feature selection for logistic regression using:Automated methods: RFE -Recursive Feature EliminationManual methods: VIF and p-value checkWe will use the ‘Telecom Churn’ dataset in this session to build a model using multivariate logistic regression. This will involve all the familiar steps such as:Data cleaning and preparationPreprocessing stepsTest-train splitFeature scalingModel Building using RFE, p-values and VIFsApart from the familiar old steps, you’ll also be introduced to something known as a confusion matrix and you’ll also learn how the accuracy is measured for a logistic regression model.\xa0PrerequisitesThere are no prerequisites for this session\xa0other than the knowledge of the previous session and the previous module.<br><br>"] </p>
