    <p> ["\xa0Welcome to session 2 of this module — ‘Divide and Conquer'. In the previous session, you learnt about the following topics:Linear searchThe divide and conquer logicBinary search\xa0In this sessionIn this session, you will learn about sorting algorithms. We shall further discuss the following sorting algorithms in this session:Bubble sortSelection sortInsertion sortPlease note that the guidelines for graded questions remain the same as they were in the previous session.\xa0\xa0People you will hear from in this session:Subject Matter ExpertAishwarya RaiEx-Product Engineer, EdgeVerveShe worked as a software developer for Finacle at Edgeverve and helped in creating financial and e-banking software applications. She is currently working with Software Development content team at UpGrad.\xa0Industry ExpertAnkit MaheshwariTechnical Lead, ImpactRunImpactRun is a fitness philanthropy Android application where your every walk or run raises funds for a social cause you care about.\xa0PresenterRachit Goyal\xa0In the next\xa0video, you will be introduced to the concept of sorting. You will also get to know the extent of its application and its importance in our daily lives.<br><br>", "Video Transcript\xa0In case you are thinking that sorting is done just to ensure the use of banner research, you are not correct. In fact, sorting has many other applications apart from the ones we mentioned before. Some of them can be like on Facebook. You can sort your newsfeed according to the time of posting or according to the most recommended on Reddit. You can sort comments by the ones which are most liked or by the time of posting. On a shopping website, you may want to list variety brands of a certain item in the order of their popularity. On a travel website, we generally list hotels either in the order of price or star ratings. All these things make your lives a lot easier, don't they? Sorting algorithms is something which has been the subject of extensive research, and many sorting algorithms have been developed over the years. They all solve the following problem that given an array of unsorted numbers, how can we sort them so that they end up in an ascending or descending order? Not only numbers, we can sort text as well in an alphabetical order. For that matter, anything can be sorted based on a key property. In this session, first we will teach you the simple and intuitive but slow order n square algorithms. And then we will teach you slightly more complex sorting algorithms based on the idea of divide and conquer which will improve the big. To order n login, we will first discuss a sorting algorithm called Bubble sort. Let's see what it is and how efficient it is.\xa0Video Recap\xa0\xa0Sorting has various applications beyond banner researchSorting on social media platforms like Facebook and Reddit allows users to sort posts and comments by time, likes, and popularityOn shopping and travel websites, sorting helps in listing products and hotels by price, brand popularity, and star ratingsSorting algorithms solve the problem of sorting unsorted data in ascending or descending orderSorting can be applied to text as well, based on a key propertyThe session teaches simple, intuitive, but slow order n square algorithms for sortingMore complex sorting algorithms based on the divide and conquer idea are also discussed to improve efficiencyThe session starts by discussing the Bubble sort algorithm and its efficiency.\xa0Great! Now you know that application sorting is not just limited to making an array eligible for a binary search. Facebook, e-commerce websites, hotel-booking websites, etc. are just a few of the many places where this is of immense use.<br><br>"] </p>
