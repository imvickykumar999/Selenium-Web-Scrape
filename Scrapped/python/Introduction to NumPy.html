    <h1> Introduction to NumPy </h1>

    <p> ['Welcome to this module on Python Libraries.\xa0In this ModuleYou will learn about three\xa0important and the most popular Python libraries for handling data:\xa0NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.\xa0This module will teach you the basics of NumPy, which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy consists of a robust data structure called multidimensional arrays. Matplotlib gives you the ability to visualise data using meaningful plots. Pandas is another powerful Python library that provides a fast and easy-to-use data analysis platform.\xa0Important Note:To enhance the learning outcome, you are expected to take a pause while watching the videos and code along with the instructor. For which, you will be provided with\xa0structured\xa0and blank Python notebook\xa0to code along with the instructor. This is must\xa0for you to answer certain in segment questions as it serves the purpose of practice and the final notebook serves the purpose of practice and will act as a reference for you in future as well.\xa0Do not expect a complete solution notebook attached\xa0at the end of the session or module.\xa0\xa0Prerequisite for this ModuleThe students are expected to have gone through "Introduction to Python Programming" module before beginning with this module.\xa0In this sessionAs part of this session, in which you will understand the advantages of using NumPy (over standard Python ways), you will also learn how to::Create NumPy arraysConvert lists and tuples to NumPy arraysInspect the structure and content of arrays<br><br>'] </p>
