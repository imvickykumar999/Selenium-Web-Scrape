    <h1> Introduction to Personas in Product Management </h1>

    ['<p>Welcome to the session on Personas.\xa0In the last session, you learnt how to gather user feedback for product development.\xa0In this sessionAs a product manager, the user is central to all your efforts. The products you develop should revolve around the user’s goals and needs. Conducting research and gathering information about your users is the first step, but you may wonder where to go from there. In other words, you may have mountains of data about the user’s background, motivations and goals, but it won’t mean anything until you start processing it and making some sense out of it.\xa0You can achieve this by creating product artefacts. These are processes and methods you can use to understand the needs of your user and figure out ways to meet these needs in the form of a product that provides significant value as well as delight. Let’s start with the first product artefact—Personas.\xa0A user persona is a representation of a particular user segment of your product or service and is created from the data gathered through user research. Creating personas for your user segments helps you identify and better understand the various kinds of people who would use your product. It also helps capture and organise your learnings from user research into tangible and useful resources which serve to improve and refine your product.\xa0The broad agenda for the session is as follows:Understanding the basics of personasLearning about the elements\xa0of a persona and the process of building a personaRevising and updating personasAnalysing some examples of personas in the industry\xa0Session ObjectivesBy the end of this session, you will be able to:Describe what personas are, and their importance in product developmentUnderstand the elements\xa0that make a personaBuild a persona through a step-by-step processUnderstand the process of revising and updating personasGuidelines for in-module questionsThe in-video and in-content (out of the video) questions for this module are not graded.\xa0\xa0People you will hear from in this sessionSubject Matter ExpertAnshumani RuddraVP of Product - Sports, Social and Gaming at HotstarAnshumani Ruddra is a mentor and advisor to a number of startups.
