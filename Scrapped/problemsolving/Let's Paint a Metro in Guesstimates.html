    <p> ["Finally, we reach a point in our module where we can start solving guesstimates. We will look at solving an interesting guesstimate. Are you ready?\xa0Let's begin.<br><br>", 'Wasn’t that brilliant!!?\xa0Let us walk through the entire process once more to get a clearer understanding of how Soumya solved the guesstimate.\xa0Problem Statement - What is the cost of paint required to paint a metro?\xa0To begin with, we will first start by understanding and clarifying a few assumptions in order to make the problem-specific. But before we do that, let us understand something else. What type of guesstimate is this?\xa0Since we are to find the cost of paint, we need to find the area of the metro to be painted. Hence, this is most definitely a Geometry or Shape-Based Guesstimate.\xa0Now, we move on to clarifying a few assumptions to narrow down the scope of the problem at hand.\xa0ClarificationsDo we have to paint one metro or do we have to paint more?What part of the metro do we want to paint? Is it the outside including the roof, the inside along with the seats and poles and the roof?Would Delhi metro as a reference be acceptable? And in that case, is it a four, six or an eight coach metro?How many coats of paint are required to be done?And most importantly, what is the cost of the paint?\xa0Based on our clarifications, we might get the following assumptions to take forward from the interviewer.\xa0AssumptionsWe have to paint only one metro.We have to paint the outside of the metro, including the roof, we can exclude the interiors.The Delhi metro is taken as reference and we can go with a six coach metro (using a proxy).The paint is very high quality so one coat is enough.The cost of the paint can be assumed to be Rs 1000/litre.Let us now move to solve. To calculate the cost of paint, we need to calculate the amount of paint. To do that, we must know the area of the surface to be painted for which we need to guesstimate the dimensions of a metro compartment.\xa0Calculating the lengthApproximate size of one seat (focus on the breadth of seat), enough for one person and then some more - 40 cm *\xa040 cmScale it up to the size of benches - either 8 seats or 2 seats in a bench. Their distribution is three\xa08-seater and two 2-seater benches (40*8)*3 = 960 and (40*2)*2 = 1604 doors in one coach - area occupied by door equal to the area occupied by one 2-seater bench (40*2)*4= 320An extra area at the end of the coaches (50*4) = 200 cmTotal length = 960 + 160 + 320 +200 = 1540 cm ~ 15 mCalculating the breadth4 people can stand side by side comfortably (2 on each side of the pole), approximately\xa0 (40*4) = 160 cmAdd two rows of seats (50X2) = 100 cm (to account for the backrest)Total breadth = 160 + 100 = 260 cm ~2.5 mCalculating height50 from the bottom + 50 of the seat = 100 cm1 A3 poster (60 cm length) + empty space to fit two seats = 60 + 50 + 50 = 160Total height = 100 + 160 = 260 cm ~ 250 cm ~2.5mAnother approach - can assume the coach to be cuboidal with breadth and height equal\xa0Area 1 = L*B (roof - 1 per coach) = 15 *\xa02.5 = 30 + 7.5 = 37.5 ~ 40 square metresArea 2= L*H (sides - 2 per coach) = 15 *\xa02.5 = 37.5 ~ 40 square metresArea 3 = B*H (front and back - 2 per train) = 2.5 *\xa02.5 = 6.25 ~ 5 square metres\xa0(Increasing and decreasing by similar magnitudes to make calculation easy and also keep the answer accurate)\xa0Number of coaches = 6\xa0Total area = A1 *\xa06 + A2 *\xa012 + A3 *\xa02\xa0\xa0= 40* 6 + 40 *\xa012 + 5 *\xa02 = 240 + 480 + 10 = 730 square metres\xa0Now to figure out how much paint is required for painting 1 sq m, you can take proxies. Imagine how much of the wall you can paint with 1l, I’m sure you must have spilt water at one point or the other, how much can a 1l water bottle cover? About 5-6 sq m? Let’s reduce it to 5 for ease of calculation and accounting for the difference viscosity in water and paint.\xa0Hence, 1 Litre\xa0can cover 5 square\xa0metres. Therefore, 730/5 = 146 Litres\xa0of paint will be required to paint the metro.Considering 5% of wastage, we get a rough figure of about 150 Litres.\xa0Therefore, the total cost will be Rs 150,000.\xa0See how easy that was when approached smartly!\xa0Let us move to yet another example of a guesstimate to further our grip on the topic.\xa0\xa0\xa0<br><br>'] </p>
