    <p> ['In the last two sessions, our subject-matter expert, Prashanth Balasubramanian, taught you the first two steps of the four-step problem-solving approach. In these steps, you learnt how to frame and analyse a problem. Now that you are well acquainted with the first two steps of this approach, let’s move onto the third step, that is, to analyse possible solutions. In this segment, you will learn about a few specific concepts on analysing solutions. Let’s get started!<br><br>', "You are now well familiar with the concepts and techniques involved in problem-solving. Now, let’s summarise the key takeaways from the video:Analysing the possible solutions to a problem includes specific activities, each of which involves the following steps:Brainstorming potential solutionsPrioritising those solutionsConsidering key implications \xa0\xa0Brainstorming and ideating solutions include certain concepts, which are mentioned in the table provided below.Design ThinkingPhased process \xa0 \xa0\xa0EmpathiseDefineIdeatePrototypeTestNon-linear process\xa0FlexibilityAbility to skip stepsIterativeAbility to review steps and make changes\xa0De Bono’s Six Thinking HatsBlue hat (Planning)Managing and controlling the situationDrawing conclusion and doing forward planningWhite hat (Facts)Understanding the context of the problemLaying out all the factsGreen hat (Ideas)\xa0Driving ideationBuilding innovative solutionsYellow hat (Benefits)Positivity and optimismDiscussion of various solutions and benefitsBlack hat (Judgement)Critical thinkingEvaluation of shortcomings in the solutionPractical approach to problem solvingRed hat (Emotion)\xa0Building trust in the solution\xa0In the next video, let's look at few more concepts to thoroughly analyse the solution:<br><br>", "Let's quickly summarise the key concepts learnt from this video:\xa0Storyboarding and Prototyping Storyboarding refers to constructing a visual representation of the solution. Its advantages are as follows:\xa0Allows you to explain the solutionOutlines the impact of the solutionHelps garner initial feedbackPrototyping refers to crafting a physical representation of your idea and then making improvements and changes to it on the basis of the feedback that you receive. The final product then makes it to the market.6-3-5 Technique This technique involves six people writing down three ideas in five minutes\xa0SCAMPER is a technique that is used to improve existing products and services. It stands for Substitute, Combine, Adjust, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate and Rearrange, which are explained below:Substitute: This involves finding a substitute for your existing product or service that may yield better results. You can then choose between the two.Combine: You can combine several different ideas and concepts to see if that works better.\xa0Adjust: This refers to making improvements in a product or service to gain better results.Modify: This step refers to modifying and making changes to an existing product or service. It brings out the innovative capabilities of an organisationPut to other use: This refers to putting the current product or service to another use.Eliminate: As the name suggests, this step aims to eliminate a product, service or concept that is less valuable than the others.Rearrange: This step refers to developing and bringing in the latest concept from a pre-existing one to solve the problem.Now you are aware of the brainstorming and ideation process for analysing solutions. In the next segment, you will learn about the tips and techniques to prioritise solutions.\xa0Additional Resources:Developing Decision Making SkillsIdentifying the Possible Solutions with\xa0The Kepner-Tregoe MatrixA Detailed Guide on Six Thinking Hats ApproachLearn How to Use the Best Ideation Methods: SCAMPER<br><br>"] </p>
