    <p> ['Have you ever taken\xa0tests that have asked you questions to understand whether you are more of a logical thinker or a creative thinker? It is primarily because the human brain is divided into two hemispheres that functions differently.\xa0\xa0Based on this approach an individual tends to have a personality\xa0that is either left-brained or right-brained. So, if you are unsure which brain type you are and would like to get a hint, then let’s watch the video and listen to our expert:<br><br>', "The split-brain theory classifies the brain’s functioning into the following two categories:\xa0Left Brain\xa0Right BrainPeople whose ‘left brain’ is dominant are said to be analytical and methodical in their thinking approach, whereas ‘right-brained’ people tend to have more artistic or creative thinking patterns.\xa0In connection with this theory, there is a left-brained approach and a right-brained approach to problem-solving.\xa0\xa0In the next video, our expert has focused on the left-brained approach to problem-solving. The left-brained approaches are logical, mathematical, factual and sequential. Some of the left-brain approaches that we’ll learn about in this segment are - Root Cause analysis, precedence chart, probabilistic decision analysis and matrix approach. Let's get started.<br><br>", 'Now, let’s summarise the left-brain tactic covered by the expert in the video:\xa0Root Cause Analysis - The tactics used here include 5 Whys and Fishbone analysis\xa0that helps identify all the potential causes of a problem.\xa0These tactics are covered in detail in the upcoming modules. \xa0Precedence Chart - The tactic used here is a network diagram to understand all the scheduled activities and its dependencies.Probabilistic Decision Analysis - The tactics used here include a tree model to weigh the pay-off of a decision by mapping its positive and negative consequences.\xa0Matrix Approach - The tactics used here include the RACI matrix, which extends\xa0to a Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed approach, and the RAPID matrix from BAIN, which extends to a Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input and Decide approach. These tactics help to collaborate with multiple stakeholders.So, these were some of the commonly used ‘left approaches’ to solve problems. As the expert suggested, these approaches are, in principle,\xa0\xa0analytical and methodical in nature.\xa0In the next segment, our expert will discuss some of the ‘right approaches’ to problem-solving.\xa0<br><br>'] </p>
